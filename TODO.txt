add error handling EVERYWHERE!

add signal handling

check correctness of send, rcv and write operations on file

add rotation (OPTIONAL)
add automated tests (HOW? Lookup on the internet how they work)


lock file for read/write to other processes (maybe)?

define exit procedure
    - if done on server, wait for all childs to terminate their connections
    - if done on child, close connection and nothing else
